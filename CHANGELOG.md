# Changelog

All notable changes to ChittyCan will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added — Repo hygiene program

- `can hygiene [path]` — six-rule repo hygiene detector (tracked build artifacts,
  unignored output dirs, non-failing CI gates, missing local hook layer, missing
  commit-message lint, deployed-without-source). `--min-severity` gates the exit
  code so it can be used as a hard CI gate; `--json` for machine consumption.
- `can hygiene --fix` — applies the auto-fixable rules (commit-msg hook,
  hook-layer wiring) and reports exactly what it changed. Low-severity fixers run
  even under `--min-severity high`, so a gate at `high` still gets its fixes.
- `can wip branches --remote` — judges `origin/*` rather than local branches, for
  use from CI where the checkout has only the default branch. Archives eligible
  tips to `refs/archive/<name>` on the remote and **never deletes**: deletions are
  reported as proposals. The default branch is read from
  `ls-remote --symref origin HEAD` and an unresolvable default throws rather than
  being guessed as `main`/`master`.
- `.github/workflows/branch-hygiene.yml` — weekly scheduled cleanup that archives
  unattended and files deletions as a single upserted tracking issue, closing it
  when the remote goes clean.
- `.github/workflows/hygiene-autofix.yml` — dispatch-only autofix that opens a PR.

### Security

- Branch names are POSIX-quoted in generated shell commands. git permits `$`, `;`,
  backticks and quotes in ref names, so an unquoted branch name in a pasteable
  command block was remote code execution against whoever pasted it.
- Proposed deletions are leased to the archived sha (`--force-with-lease`), so a
  branch that received commits after being archived cannot be destroyed by a
  stale proposal.
- Archive writes carry an explicit lease, closing a check-then-write race that
  could silently overwrite a previously archived tip.

## [0.5.0] - Upcoming (Q1 2025)

### Added - 🏛️ Foundation Governance & DNA Ownership

**ChittyCan is now governed by the ChittyFoundation Charter v0.1** - a comprehensive framework that protects human dignity, ownership, and fairness in AI systems.

**🧬 DNA Vault System**
- ✨ Encrypted local DNA storage with AES-256-GCM
- ✨ User-controlled encryption keys (`~/.chittycan/dna/keys/master.key`)
- ✨ Git-like versioning with snapshot history (last 30 snapshots)
- ✨ PDX-compliant manifest for portability
- ✨ Complete ownership: Your DNA belongs to you, not ChittyCan

**📦 PDX v1.0 Implementation (Portable DNA eXchange)**
- ✨ `can dna export` - Export DNA in PDX format (full or hash-only privacy)
- ✨ `can dna import <file>` - Import DNA from other tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf)
- ✨ Conflict resolution: merge, replace, rename, or skip duplicate patterns
- ✨ Integrity verification: SHA-256 hashing + cryptographic signatures
- ✨ Rate limiting: 1 export per 24 hours (Bronze tier) to prevent abuse
- ✨ Cross-platform compatibility: JSON-LD format with semantic versioning

**🔒 Privacy-Preserving Audit System**
- ✨ Hash-only event logging - no raw content exposure
- ✨ Audit trail at `~/.chittycan/audit/learning-events.jsonl`
- ✨ DNA mutation history at `~/.chittycan/audit/mutations.jsonl`
- ✨ Export/import tracking at `~/.chittycan/audit/export-imports.jsonl`
- ✨ Privacy with proof: verifiable without revealing patterns

**🎯 DNA Management Commands**
- ✨ `can dna status` - Show DNA statistics and top patterns

**📊 Foundation Compliance Dashboard**
- ✨ Bronze Tier certification requirements
- ✨ Portability success rate tracking
- ✨ Privacy audit completeness
- ✨ User satisfaction metrics
- ✨ Public transparency reporting

**🏛️ Foundation Principles**

ChittyCan adheres to these non-negotiable principles:

1. **You Own Your Data & DNA** - Individuals own decision patterns; orgs obtain licenses
2. **Portability by Default** - Export, revoke, and migrate are baseline rights
3. **Attribution → Compensation** - Traceable contributions map to loyalty-based compensation (v0.6.0)
4. **Privacy with Proof** - Content stays private; proofs remain verifiable
5. **Human Safety & Dignity** - No surveillance abuse, coercion, or harm
6. **Transparency over Theater** - Decisions and metrics are auditable
7. **Diversity as Resilience** - Multi-provider support prevents vendor lock-in

**🎖️ ChittyCertified Roadmap**

| Tier | Target | Key Features |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | v0.5.0 (Q1 2025) | DNA vaults, PDX export/import, privacy audits |

## [0.4.3] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed - 🔧 CLI Solution Provider

**Problem:** Commands were hanging or trying to call external `chitty` CLI that didn't exist.

**Solution:** Rebuilt `can chitty` as a fully local, conversational CLI solution provider with "Grow With Me" intelligence.

### Added - 🌱 Evolution from Asking to Commanding

**The Journey:**
1. **Beginner**: `can chitty gh clone my repo` (explicit, guided)
2. **Intermediate**: `can gh clone my repo` (direct CLI routing)
3. **Advanced**: System learns your patterns and personalizes itself

**Natural Language CLI Interface:**
- 🚀 Natural language commands WITHOUT quotes - just type naturally!
- 🔍 Auto-detects CLI tool from context (gh, docker, git, kubectl, etc.)
- ✅ Checks if CLI is installed - offers installation guidance if not
- 🔐 Checks if auth/remote is configured - guides through setup if missing
- 💬 Shows abbreviated command before execution - no surprises
- 🤝 Interactive confirmation - "Proceed? [Y/n]"
- 🧠 Uses configured AI remotes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Groq)
- 🎯 Especially powerful for complex CLIs like GitHub CLI (gh)

**Direct CLI Routing:**
- ⚡ Skip `chitty` prefix: `can gh clone repo` instead of `can chitty gh clone repo`
- 🎪 Automatic routing when first arg is supported CLI
- 📊 14+ supported CLIs: gh, docker, kubectl, git, npm, aws, gcloud, az, terraform, helm, cargo, pip, yarn, pnpm

**Usage Tracking & Learning:**
- 📈 Tracks every command you run (stored locally in `~/.chittycan/usage.json`)
- 🧠 Learns which CLIs you use most
- 🎯 Identifies your frequent patterns
- 💡 Provides personalized suggestions based on your usage
- 📊 `can chitty insights` - View your usage patterns and statistics
- 🌱 Grows with you - the more you use it, the better it gets

**Custom Workflows:**
- 🔧 Define your own chitty commands in `~/.chittycan/workflows.json`
- ⚙️ Support for multiple step types: command, url, webhook, delay
- 🎯 Example: `can chitty start coffee` → triggers IFTTT coffee machine
- 🚀 Example: `can chitty start work` → opens all your work apps
- 🏗️ Example: `can chitty deploy prod` → runs custom deployment workflow
- 📋 `can chitty workflows` - List all custom workflows
- 📊 Tracks usage count and last used time for each workflow

**Example Flows:**

Basic CLI command:
```bash
$ can gh clone my repo
🤖 Understanding: gh clone my repo
   Detected: GitHub CLI
   Using remote: my-github

chitty can:
  gh repo clone username/repo

  using github-remote: my-github

  Proceed? [Y/n]
```

Custom workflow:
```bash
$ can chitty start work
🔧 Found custom workflow: Start Work
   Open work apps and setup

[1/3] Open GitHub
✓ Step 1 complete

[2/3] Open Linear
✓ Step 2 complete

[3/3] Open VS Code in projects folder
✓ Step 3 complete

✓ Workflow complete!
```

Usage insights:
```bash
$ can chitty insights
📊 Your ChittyCan Usage Insights

Most Used CLIs:
  gh: 45 times
  docker: 23 times
  git: 18 times

🎯 Your Frequent Patterns:
