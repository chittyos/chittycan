## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"ChittyCan is your CLI solution provider. Instead of memorizing complex syntax for tools like GitHub CLI, Docker, or Kubernetes, you just speak naturally. 'Can gh clone my repo' becomes 'gh repo clone username/repo'. It learns your patterns over time and lets you create custom workflows like 'start coffee' to trigger your smart coffee machine. Free, open source, works with Claude, and all learning happens locally on your machine."

**Q: What CLIs are supported?**
A: 14+ today: gh, docker, kubectl, git, aws, gcloud, azure, terraform, npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, cargo, helm. Request more via GitHub issues.

**Q: Is it production-ready?**
A: Developer preview. We use it daily. Building in public, improving based on feedback.

**Q: How does MCP integration work?**
A: ChittyCan exposes MCP servers that Claude can use for seamless AI → CLI workflows.
